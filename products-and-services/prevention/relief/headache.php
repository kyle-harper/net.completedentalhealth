				<h2><br /><b>A Safer Approach to Headache Relief</b><br /></h2>
                <p>
                    Oftentimes, people suffering from chronic pain such as migraines will resort to medications or even surgery in an attempt to rid themselves of debilitating and constant pain. We urge you to consider an affordable, non-invasive, wearable night guard called an NTI before pursuing the more invasive, costly, and risky treatments out there.
					<br />
				<p class="blockquote">
					Dr. Collins is a trusted NTI and headache dentist in San Diego, specializing in <a href="products-and-services/cosmetic/minimally-invasive-dentistry.php">minimally-invasive dentistry</a>, with over 20 years of experience treating pain of the head, neck, and jaw. He wants you to know that you need not live in constant pain any longer. The solution may be simpler than you think! <br /><br />Before resigning yourself to a lifetime of medications or attempting risky surgeries, we urge you to contact us today to set up a time to discuss your treatment options with Dr. Collins.
				</p>
				<h3><br /><b>Why See a Dentist for Headaches?</b><br /></h3>
				<p>
                    As you may have already witnessed or experienced, the stresses of everyday life often cause us to clench and grind our teeth while we sleep. This can diminish the quality of our sleep, cause us to feel even more tired upon waking, or in more serious cases can even result in severe pain and swelling of the jaw muscles, migraine headaches, and physical damage to the teeth such as chipping and cracking.
					<br /><br />In many cases of chronic pain of the head, neck, and jaw, the cause can be traced back to this nighttime jaw clenching, as well as untreated <a href="products-and-services/prevention/relief/tmj.php">TMJ disorder</a>.
					<br /><br />In cases of pain associated with clenching and TMJ, the dentist is your best source for treatment. Medications will just be covering up the symptoms, not addressing the root of the problem. And in all but the most extreme of cases, surgery is not necessary.
					<br />
                </p>
				<h4><br /><b>How Does the NTI Work to Alleviate Headaches?</b><br /></h4>
				<p>
					The NTI is a small plastic night guard, worn at night over the front teeth, which effectively &#8220;turns off&#8221; the brain&#146;s signal to clench the jaw muscles. Because your jaw muscles are relaxed, you can sleep more soundly, your head, neck, and jaw muscles can rest and recuperate, and your symptoms of pain will start to diminish in a matter of days or weeks.
					<br /><br />In Dr. Collins&#146; decades of experience treating chronic pain, the NTI mouth guard is the single most effective tool he has ever seen for relieving symptoms of migraines, tension headaches, muscle pain, and TMJ disorder&#8212;with the added bonus of preventing damage to the teeth.
