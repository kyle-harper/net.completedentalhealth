                <p>
                    Dr. Tim Collins, DDS is an expert headache and NTI dentist in San Diego, with over 20 years of experience in neuromuscular pain reduction and other pain management therapies.
					<br /><br />From Dr. Collins&#146; perspective, the NTI device has been and continues to be the single most effective tool for easing chronic headaches, reducing or eliminating <a href="products-and-services/prevention/relief/tmj.php">symptoms of TMJ disorder</a>, improving sleep quality, reducing tension due to stress, and protecting teeth from damage due to grinding during sleep.
					<br />
                </p>
				<h2><br /><b>What is the NTI Device?</b><br /></h2>
                <p>
                    In plain English, the NTI is a small, affordable, durable plastic mouth guard worn over the front teeth, which works by keeping the back teeth from touching&#8212;this effectively &#8220;turns off&#8221; the brain&#146;s signal to clench.
					<br /><br />Want to know more of the technical stuff? Warning, we are about to get geeky. 
					<br /><br />NTI&#8212;or more specifically, NTI-tss&#8212;stands for &#8220;nociceptive trigeminal inhibition tension suppression system&#8221;. While it is more than a mouthful to say, the NTI is an even bigger deal when it comes to neuromuscular pain reduction and protection of tooth structure.
					<br /><br />A (slightly) less geeky way of describing the NTI is to say that it eases tension on the jaw by inhibiting the brain from activating the jaw&#146;s powerful clenching muscles via the trigeminal nerve. If the brain cannot tell the jaw to clench down, then your jaw muscles stay relaxed and you wake up feeling more refreshed. As an added bonus, the NTI keeps the upper and lower teeth from touching so your natural and cosmetically-restored teeth are protected from chipping or cracking while you sleep.
					<br />

				<h3><br /><b>Why Choose Complete Dental Health for the NTI Night Guard in San Diego?</b><br /></h3>
				<p>
                    The NTI requires experience, finesse, and patience to properly fit and adjust. NTIs are only effective if they are correctly adjusted; improperly fitted NTIs can actually do more harm than good to your jaw!

					<br /><br />Dr. Collins also includes follow-up visits to ensure each patient&#146;s NTI fits properly and comfortably, and most importantly he verifies the device is doing the most effective job at treating each patient&#146;s specific symptoms.
					<br />
