				<br /><br />
				<p class="blockquote">
					Dr. Tim Collins, DDS is an expert pain relief dentist in San Diego, with over 20 years of experience in neuromuscular pain reduction and other pain management therapies.
	`			</p>
	`			<h2>What medical conditions does Dr. Collins treat?</h2>
				<p>
					Dr. Collins has effectively treated a wide range of conditions through non-invasive approaches, such as chronic head and neck pain, migraine headaches, TMJ disorder, sleep apnea, and snoring.				
				</p>
				<h3><br />Non-invasive Chronic Pain Therapies</h3>
				<p>
					Any chronic pain you are experiencing from the neck up, whether it be a <a href="products-and-services/prevention/relief/headache.php">migraine headache</a>, muscle tension, jaw pain, <a href="products-and-services/prevention/relief/tmj.php">TMJ disorder</a>, or fatigue, may be traceable back to how your jaw subconsciously clenches and grinds.
					<br /><br />In Dr. Collins&#146; decades of experience, a simple, wearable device known as an <a href="products-and-services/prevention/relief/nti.php">NTI</a> has proven to be the most effective therapy for relieving chronic pain of the head, neck and jaw.
					<br /><br />The NTI can also help the healing process for acute head and neck injuries, such as whiplash. By relaxing the jaw, the NTI facilitates the healing process and prevents the brain's signal to clench from causing any further damage or injury.
				</p>
				<h4><br />Sleep Apnea and Snoring Relief</h4>
				<p>
					If you suffer from sleep apnea or snoring, or if you know someone who does, please <a href="contact.php">contact our office</a> for a free consultation. These can be symptoms of a serious medical condition, and professional treatment is advised.
					<br /><br />In the case of sleep apnea, there are several options for treatment which can be very costly and cumbersome. If you suffer from sleep apnea, especially if you have tried and are fed up with convoluted breathing apparatus such as CPAP, a simple, affordable mouth guard device known as a <a href="products-and-services/prevention/relief/tap.php">TAP Appliance</a> may be the answer to your suffering.
					<br /><br />The TAP Appliance also has the added benefit of curing <a href="products-and-services/prevention/relief/snoring.php">snoring</a> &#8211; something which many other, more costly devices cannot claim. Many of our patients who snore, even those without diagnosed sleep apnea, find the TAP Appliance to be a miracle device for better sleep (and their spouses thank us, too!).
