			<h2><br />Renew Your Smile with Porcelain Veneers</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most popular cosmetic dentistry treatments our patients seek is porcelain veneers &#8211; ultra-thin slips of durable porcelain that are custom-made for each individual patient by a skilled ceramicist and placed by a cosmetic dentist.
				<br /><br />Veneers can conceal a number of cosmetic ills, including stains, misshapen teeth, and minor tooth misalignment. The result is a more beautiful smile with enhanced brightness, color, shape, and symmetry.
				<br /><br />
				<p class="blockquote">
					In the right hands, porcelain veneers can look completely natural.
				</p>
				<br />At Complete Dental Health, Dr. Tim Collins, DDS consistently achieves beautiful and natural-looking results with porcelain veneers.
			</p>
			<h3><br />Porcelain Veneer Candidates</h3>
			<p>
				Since Dr. Collins is a <a href="products-and-services/cosmetic/minimally-invasive-dentistry.php">minimally-invasive dentist</a> in San Diego, he does not recommend all patients to be candidates for veneers. Dr. Collins will not sacrifice healthy tooth structure for cosmetic results alone, as this could compromise the long-term health of your teeth and gums.
				<br /><br />If Dr. Collins determines porcelain veneers to be the best course of action for you, it means the veneers will improve both the look and health of your smile for the long term.
				<br /><br />To be an ideal candidate for veneers, you must have a defect, damage or misalignment in one or more front teeth, and want to transform the appearance of your smile.
				<br /><br />You may wish to conceal teeth that are worn, cracked, chipped, stained, or misaligned. Consider the following before choosing veneers as the best option:
				<ul>
					<li>Although porcelain veneers are fondly called &#34;instant orthodontics&#34;, if you have severe misalignment or bite problems, you may benefit more from braces or <a href="products-and-services/cosmetic/invisalign/index.php">Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span></a> prior to other cosmetic enhancements.</li>
					<li>In many cases, <a href="products-and-services/cosmetic/bonding.php">dental bonding</a> may be enough to repair damaged teeth and to enhance your natural-looking smile.</li>
					<li>If there is too much damage to the tooth, a <a href="products-and-services/cosmetic/crowns-onlays-inlays.php">porcelain crown</a> may be necessary to protect the tooth more effectively than a veneer.</li>
				</ul>
				Before getting porcelain veneers, Dr. Collins requires you to have excellent <a href="products-and-services/prevention/cleanings-and-checkups/index.php">oral health</a>. Tooth decay, gum disease, and broken or damaged teeth should be treated prior to the placement of porcelain veneers, to ensure the veneers last.
			</p>
			<h4><br />Placement of Porcelain Veneers</h4>
			<p>
				The placement of your porcelain veneers will take around two visits to our office at Complete Dental Health.
				<br /><br />After developing a <a href="products-and-services/cosmetic/smile-makeover.php">smile makeover</a> plan that is designed to complement your coloring, bone structure, and mouth shape, Dr. Collins will prepare your teeth to receive porcelain veneers. This involves removing a small amount of tooth enamel in order to make room for the veneers.
				<br /><br />Then, Dr. Collins will make a mold of your teeth, which will be used to create your veneers in the lab. During your second visit, your Dr. Collins will ensure that your veneers look natural and fit perfectly before bonding them permanently into place.
			</p>
			<h5><br />Cost of Porcelain Veneers</h5>
			<p>
				The cost of porcelain veneers depends on the number of teeth you need treated, the positions of those teeth, and the complexity of the treatment. We offer a free consultation for you to come in and have Dr. Collins assess your needs based on the results you desire.
				<br /><br />Once Dr. Collins provides his recommendations, we can tell you then and there how much your treatment would cost. We also work with your <a href="patient-resources/insurance.php">dental insurance</a> plan and we offer <a href="patient-resources/financing-options.php">flexible financing options</a> such as CareCredit.
