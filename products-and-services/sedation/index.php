				<p>
					Oral sedation takes the anxiety out of going to the dentist. Individuals with dental phobia, people with extreme tooth sensitivity, and those who cannot control their gag reflex may be good candidates for sedation dentistry. A discussion with a sedation dentist can help you determine whether sedation dentistry may be suitable for you.
					<br /><br />While many people don&#146;t particularly enjoy going to the dentist, some experience excessive anxiety at the thought of undergoing any kind of dental treatment.
					<br /><br />Known as dental anxiety or dental phobia, this fear can cause people to postpone treatment, often to the detriment of the health of their teeth and gums.
					<br /><br />
					<p class="blockquote">
						If you suffer from dental anxiety, you can rest easier knowing that Dr. Collins is an expert sedation dentist here at Complete Dental Health in San Diego.
					</p>
					<br />Administered by an experienced sedation dentist, oral sedation allows you to relax while we improve your smile with general dentistry or cosmetic dentistry treatments of the highest quality.
                </p>
                <h2><br />How Does Oral Sedation Work?</h2>
				<p>
                    One hour prior to your dental treatment, you will take a <a href="products-and-services/sedation/halcion.php">sedative pill</a> in our office.
					<br /><br />During treatment, you will be in a relaxed, sleep-like state. We will carefully monitor your vital signs, responsiveness, and oxygen levels. Although you will be able to respond to questions or commands, you will have little memory of the procedure. You will need a companion to drive you home from our office, and stay with you for the rest of the day.<br />
                </p>
                <h3><br />Sedation Dentistry Candidates</h3>
				<p>
                    Many people who suffer from dental anxiety make good candidates for sedation dentistry. Ideal candidates include individuals who have had traumatic dental experiences and those who have a high level of fear regarding needles or shots.
					<br /><br />Sedation dentistry isn't reserved solely for the dental phobic, however. If you have difficulty undergoing dental care due to a severe gag reflex or sensitive teeth, oral sedation may help you. Additionally, people who must undergo extensive dental procedures may be candidates for sedation dentistry. Beyond creating an optimal environment for you, sedation dentistry allows us to complete multiple treatments in one appointment. You can relax while we improve your smile.<br />
                </p>
