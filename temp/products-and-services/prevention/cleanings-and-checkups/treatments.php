                    <b>Cleanings and Checkups</b><br />
                    Periodic cleanings and checkups play a vital role in keeping your smile healthy and looking its best. Regular dental exams can alert you to changes in your oral health, allowing you to take action before further damage occurs. Even if you are extremely conscientious about brushing and flossing, tartar can build up at and below the gum line. Tartar provides the perfect environment for bacteria to thrive, which can lead to the development of gum disease. During cleanings, we customize your treatment from a variety of methods including ultrasonic and laser technology to remove tartar buildup and kill unhealthy bacteria that live below the gum line.<br />

                    <br /><b>Digital Radiographs</b><br />
                    While obtaining x-ray images of your teeth may be necessary for our dentist to diagnose and develop treatment plans, unnecessary exposure to radiation is not. Digital radiography exposes patients to less radiation&#151;up to 90 percent less&#151;and produces clear, high-resolution images that help us easily see areas of concern. Because the digital images appear on a computer monitor, digital radiography is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional film x-rays.

                    <br /><b>Laser Periodontal Treatment</b><br />
                    Laser periodontal therapy can treat gum disease and restore dental health. By performing periodontal treatment with a laser, our hygienists are able to improve our patients' comfort levels and speed the healing process.
