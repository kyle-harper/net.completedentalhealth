                    Connecting the lower jaw to the temporal bone of the skull, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) allows the jaw to produce the movements necessary for chewing and talking, activities many of us take for granted. A disorder of the TMJ can make these everyday actions uncomfortable, even painful. People with TMJ disorders may also experience head and neck pain, swelling, and other symptoms. At Complete Dental Health, Dr. Collins can diagnose and treat TMJ disorders for patients in order to improve their quality of life.<br>

                    <br><b>TMJ Treatment Options</b><br>
                    Because TMJ can be caused by clenching or grinding the teeth, a device known as an NTI appliance may help to alleviate symptoms. Custom-fitted to each individual patient, the NTI appliance fits over the front teeth. When the jaws close, only the front teeth make contact with each other. This contact stimulates a reflex that inhibits the jaw muscles from clenching.  Like night guards, NTIs also prevent wear and tear on the teeth caused by grinding.
                    <br /><br />
					NTIs are only effective if they are correctly adjusted. Dr. Timothy Collins is an expert in the fitting and adjustment of NTI appliances.
