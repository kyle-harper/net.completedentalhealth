                    The T.A.P. Appliance is a simple, yet highly effective device in the battle against sleep apnea. It repositions the jaw to allow for easier breathing and can vastly improve quality of sleep, leading to a better overall quality of life.<br />

                    <br><b>Sleep Apnea</b><br>
                    Affecting over 12 million Americans, sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed and untreated. The normal breathing cycle of a person with sleep apnea is interrupted repeatedly while he or she sleeps.  According to the American Sleep Apnea Association (ASAA), sleep apnea can have serious health consequences, including headaches, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, impotence, weight gain, and life-threatening cardiovascular problems. 
                    <br /><br />There are three types of sleep apnea: obstructive, central, and mixed. As its name implies, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by an obstruction in the upper airway. Commonly, this blockage occurs when the muscles at the rear of the throat relax and the soft tissue collapses. In central sleep apnea, the brain fails to send the proper signals to the lungs and diaphragm. Mixed sleep apnea is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea. 
                    Our dentist provides patients of our San Diego dentistry practice with proven sleep apnea treatments. After determining your unique situation, Dr. Collins will recommend the treatment that best fits your needs. Possible treatments include oral appliances, airway pressure devices, and combination therapies.<br />
