                    An alternative to traditional metal, or amalgam, fillings, tooth-colored fillings are made from a composite resin material. Because the resin is harder and more durable than metal fillings, tooth-colored fillings tend to last longer than their amalgam counterparts. They also look more natural. With tooth-colored fillings, people will be looking at you and not your metal fillings when you talk and laugh. Visit our <a href="fillings.php">tooth-colored fillings page</a> to read more.<br />

                    Teeth that are weak, fractured, cracked, misshapen, or discolored can be restored through the use of porcelain crowns, onlays, and inlays. While porcelain crowns cover teeth entirely to improve their strength and appearance, onlays cover only part of the tooth. They can be used to repair decay and strengthen damaged teeth. When damage and decay occurs on the indented top surfaces of teeth, however, inlays may be the optimal solution. Dental inlays are often preferred to metal fillings because of their natural appearance and durability.

                    Dental bonding provides a versatile solution to a number of cosmetic concerns. Among its many uses, dental bonding can fill cavities, repair chips and cracks, and alter the shape and size of teeth. Often completed in one office visit, the dental bonding procedure begins with the preparation of the tooth to be treated. After the surface of the tooth is roughened, the bonding material is applied and molded to achieve the desired appearance. Then, the bonding material is hardened using an ultraviolet light, and the procedure is complete. Visit our <a href="bonding.php">dental bonding page</a> to read more.<br />

Because your porcelain veneers will be custom made for you and you alone, they will look natural â€” like your teeth, only better.

                    Despite the fact that the placement of dental implants is rising in popularity as a more comfortable, permanent way to replace missing teeth, dentures are still a mainstay of tooth replacement. Furthermore, new innovations have made the dentures of today much more comfortable and natural-looking than those worn by previous generations.
