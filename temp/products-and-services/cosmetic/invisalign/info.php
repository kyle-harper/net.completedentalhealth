                    <br /><b>What is Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span>?</b><br />
                    Designed in Santa Clara, California, Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> has given over 1 million people around the world straighter teeth and more beautiful smiles.  Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> is an amazing, convenient and comfortable alternative to traditional metal braces.  Using a series of removable aligners made specifically for your teeth, Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> corrects an array of dental issues.  Arguably the best feature of Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> is the transparency of the aligners, making it practically impossible for anyone to notice them so you feel comfortable and confident while receiving treatment.
                    <br /><br /><br /><b>Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> is designed to treat several dental and orthodontic problems including the following:</b><br /><br />
                </p>
                <ul class="text-section-body">
                    <li>Crowding &#8211; Which when left untreated can cause tooth decay and lead to gum disease.</li>
                    <li>Spacing &#8211; Caused by abnormal jaw growth can cause a variety of periodontal diseases.</li>
                    <li>Crossbites &#8211; Due to misaligned jaw bones, can cause tooth-wear, gum disease and bone loss.</li>
                    <li>Overbites &#8211; Leads to gum irritation, wear on the lower teeth and painful joint and jaw problems.</li>
                    <li>Underbites &#8211; Prevent the teeth from functioning properly causing tooth wear and painful jaw and joint issues.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p class="text-section-body">
                    <br /><br /><b>The benefits of Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> are many:</b><br /><br />
                </p>
                <ul class="text-section-body">
                    <li>Health &#8211; By correcting dental issues early on, you can prevent numerous health problems down the road including: tooth and gum diseases, tooth-wear and painful jaw and joint problems.  With traditional braces, a process called demineralization (tooth decay) occurs in 50% of patients because they cannot be removed for eating or cleaning for an average of 2-5 years!  Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> naturally avoids this health concern.</li>
                    <li>Cosmetic &#8211; The aligners are completely removable and clear so it&#146;s unlikely anyone will notice them allowing you can transform your smile invisibly.  It&#146;s perfect for the working professional who doesn&#146;t want their clients to be distracted by crooked teeth or unattractive metal, and ideal for students who are already dealing with enough pressure at school.</li>
                    <li>Cleaning &#8211; Since the aligners are removable you can take them out to eat and brush so there&#146;s no worry of food getting stuck in between metal wires.  You are better able to maintain good oral hygiene by reducing plaque buildup and tooth decay.</li>
                    <li>Comfort &#8211; Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> moves teeth with less force than traditional braces.  Correcting misaligned teeth prevents and/or relieves pain in the jaw bone and jaw joints.</li>
                    <li>Fast Results &#8211; Compared to traditional braces, Invisalign<span class="text-sup">&#174;</span> may work faster; an average of 12-18 months vs. 36-96 months for braces.</li>
                </ul>
