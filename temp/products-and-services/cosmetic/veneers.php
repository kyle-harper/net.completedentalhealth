                    <b>Renew Your Smile with Porcelain Veneers at Our San Diego Practice</b></a><br />
                    One of the most popular cosmetic dentistry treatments, porcelain veneers are ultra-thin slips of durable porcelain that are custom-made for each individual patient by a skilled ceramicist and placed by a cosmetic dentist. Porcelain veneers can conceal a number of cosmetic ills, including stains, misshapen teeth, and minor tooth misalignment. The result is a more beautiful smile with enhanced brightness, color, shape, and symmetry. In the right hands, porcelain veneers can look completely natural. At our San Diego dentistry practice, our experienced cosmetic dentist consistently achieves beautiful and natural-looking results with porcelain veneers.<br />

                    <br /><b>Dental Veneer Candidates</b></a><br />
                    To be an ideal candidate for porcelain veneers you must want to transform the appearance of your smile. You may wish to conceal teeth that are worn, cracked, chipped, stained, or misaligned. Although porcelain veneers are fondly called "instant orthodontics," if you have severe misalignment or bite problems, you may benefit more from braces or Invisalign&#174;. <br /><br />
                    Before getting porcelain veneers, you should have excellent oral health. Tooth decay, gum disease, and broken or damaged teeth should be treated prior to the placement of porcelain veneers.<br />
                </p>

                    <br /><b>Placing Porcelain Veneers</b></a><br />
                    The placement of your porcelain veneers will take around two visits to our San Diego cosmetic dentistry practice. After developing a smile plan that is designed to complement your coloring, bone structure, and mouth shape, Dr. Collins will prepare your teeth to receive porcelain veneers. This involves removing a small amount of tooth enamel in order to make room for the veneers. Then, your dentist will make a mold of your teeth, which will be used to create your veneers. During your second visit, your dentist will ensure that your veneers look natural and fit perfectly before bonding them into place.<br />
