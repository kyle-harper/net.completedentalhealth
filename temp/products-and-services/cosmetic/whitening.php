                    Professional teeth whitening is quite possibly the quickest and easiest way to treat your smile to a mini makeover. This process can renew and brighten the appearance of your smile by removing stains left behind by smoking; drinking coffee, tea, or red wine; eating certain foods; and taking some kinds of medications.<br /><br />
                    Over-the-counter teeth whitening kits often are not effective enough to restore yellowed or stained teeth to a brighter, more youthful-looking appearance. They can even cause more harm than good, resulting in sensitivity, uneven whitening, or damage to the teeth or gums. We offer safe and effective teeth whitening kits at our San Diego cosmetic dentistry practice using Zoom!&#153; teeth whitening gel, a superior product that produces amazing results quickly and safely in the comfort of your own home. Our cosmetic dentist often uses professional teeth whitening to augment the results of Invisalign&#174; and other cosmetic dentistry treatments.<br />

                    <br /><b>Teeth Whitening Procedure</b></a><br />
                    After you get settled in one of our comfortable chairs, we will take an impression of your teeth. This process takes about half an hour and you will be on your way. The impression is used to create custom whitening trays specifically shaped to your teeth for the whitening process. We create the custom whitening trays on-site in our laboratory within 1-2 business days. (Note: if you currently use an Invisalign&#174; aligner or retainer, you can skip this step and use your Invisalign&#174; trays!)<br /><br />
                    Once you have your trays, you can then whiten in the comfort of your home by applying the Zoom!&#153; whitening gel to the trays and wearing them for about 15 minutes at the end of each day for about a week depending on your desired results.<br />

                    <br /><b>Teeth Whitening Results</b></a><br />
                    The outcome of our professional-strength, take-home teeth whitening kit is a noticeably whiter, brighter smile. Many patients are thrilled when they realize that their smiles have been whitened by several shades. To keep your pearly whites looking their best, our cosmetic dentist recommends brushing twice daily, flossing regularly, and touching up your smile occasionally with our whitening system.<br />
