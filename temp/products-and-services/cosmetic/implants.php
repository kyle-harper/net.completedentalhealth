                    One of the most exciting advancements in modern dentistry, dental implants can transform both the health and the appearance of your smile by replacing missing teeth. Dental implants are designed to mimic the form and function of a person's natural teeth. Consisting of a strong titanium artificial tooth root crowned with a natural-looking replacement tooth, a dental implant combines strength and durability with aesthetic appeal.
                    <br /><br />Many patients of our San Diego dentistry practice prefer dental implants to other tooth replacement solutions, such as dentures and dental bridges, finding them more comfortable and convenient. Imagine not having to worry about your dentures becoming dislodged and falling out while eating, drinking, talking, or laughing. Because dental implants are secured to the jawbone, implant dentistry patients can engage in daily activities worry free.
                    <br /><br />In addition to the obvious benefits of looking and feeling like natural teeth, dental implants can improve the health of your smile. Because the normal action of chewing stimulates the underlying jawbone and helps to preserve bone density, the loss of one or more teeth is often associated with bone deterioration. Dental implants restore the beneficial relationship between tooth and jawbone.<br />
