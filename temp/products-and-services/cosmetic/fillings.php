                    At our office we prefer to provide our patients with the newest and best alternatives available, which are bonded ceramic composite resins. Not only do they look natural, they provide a much better service and protection for your teeth, as they eliminate all the shortcomings of the old-fashioned silver fillings. They seal the teeth better, insulate against hot and cold better, and if they wear down they can be repaired more easily. Many people who are undergoing a cosmetic improvement on their front teeth elect to have dark silver fillings in their back teeth replaced with the bonded ceramic resins to provide a total cosmetic improvement. Please call the office if you want to look into replacing any of your old, unsightly silver fillings.<br />

                    <br /><b>Why We Do Not Use Amalgams/Mercury Fillings - Facts about Amalgam</b></a><br />
                    For years there has been debate in the dental profession regarding the pros and cons of using silver amalgam fillings, which contain about 50% mercury, to restore cavities. While it has not been proven scientifically that the mercury in silver amalgam/mercury fillings can harm you, we have chosen to not use silver amalgam/mercury fillings, as the technology involved with them is well over 100 years old. Bonded ceramic composite resins are simply a superior product.<br />
