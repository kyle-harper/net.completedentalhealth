                    Are you in desperate need of dental care, but too afraid to go to the dentist? Are you facing extensive treatment which you cannot fathom without being "out"? You are not alone. For our patients who need that extra help to relax, we offer oral sedation.
                </p>
                <p class="text-section-body">
                    <br /><b>How it Works</b><br />
                    First, we review your medical history. If cleared by your MD, you are given a pill to take one hour prior to your dental appointment. You will need a companion to drive you to and from the dental office. The pill works quickly to create a relaxed state so you will be drowsy when you arrive. During treatment, your vital signs will be monitored while you are in a sleep-like state. You will be able to respond to any given commands or questions, but will not likely recall events while the drug is in effect. This is ideal for the dental phobic patient.
                    <br /><br />Beyond creating an optimal environment for you, sedation dentistry allows us to complete multiple treatments in one appointment. You can relax while we improve your smile.
