                    <b>Do you take my insurance?</b>
                    <br />If you have a dental insurance plan that allows you to see a dentist of your choice (PPO), we will be happy to take care of all the insurance billing and paperwork.  However, we are out of network (i.e., not preferred providers) with all dental plans.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Do you accept referrals?</b>
                    <br />We welcome them!  The greatest compliment you can pay us is trusting us with the care of your friends and family members.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Is my treatment going to be painful?</b>
                    <br />We&#146;ll do our very best to ensure that it&#146;s not.  Both of our doctors are very gentle and are careful to make sure that you&#146;re completely numb before any work begins.  If you&#146;re nervous or tense about receiving dental care, we offer options such as oral sedation and nitrous oxide that can help you relax during your treatment.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Can I get all my work done at once?</b>
                    <br />The use of oral sedation often makes it possible for patients to have many procedures done at one time.  If this is something you&#146;d like to do, please talk with our doctors.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Can you straighten my teeth?</b>
                    <br />Many of our patients have achieved straighter teeth through the use of Invisalign&#174; invisible braces.  Dr. Tim Collins is one of the top dentists in the San Diego area when it comes to the use of Invisalign&#174;. 
                    <br /><br />
                    If you&#146;re interested in getting straighter teeth without the use of unattractive metal braces, please <a href="../contact.php">call our office</a> for an evaluation appointment.
