                        Often, porcelain veneers can provide a completely improved and dazzling smile in just a few appointments.
                        <The actual treatment usually involves only two visits. The number of pre-operative visits, to work out details to insure predictable results, depends on the complexity of your situation and the changes you desire. There usually is a follow up visit or two for final adjustments and polishing, and to review instructions for care of your new smile to insure it lasts years and years.<br />

                    <li><a href="../products-and-services/cosmetic/dentures.php">Complete and Partial Dentures</a> - Despite the fact that the placement of dental implants is rising in popularity as a more comfortable, permanent way to replace missing teeth, dentures are still a mainstay of tooth replacement. Furthermore, new innovations have made the dentures of today much more comfortable and natural-looking than those worn by previous generations.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li><a href="../products-and-services/cosmetic/implants.php">Dental Implants</a> - Permanent, Secure Tooth Replacements - When people lose permanent teeth due to accident, injury, disease or extraction, dental implants can be a secure, functional replacement option.
                        When permanent teeth are lost, regardless of the reason or number of teeth, dental implants can offer a &#147;new lease on life.&#148; They are superior to other choices because they are solid, secure, and esthetic. After nearly 35 years of use, they have a 90-95% proven success rate in appropriately chosen cases.
                        An implant is a special surgical grade titanium post, manufactured to highly precise specifications, under strict sterile conditions, that is inserted surgically into the jawbone below the gum surface. With proper use of the newest anesthetics and medications you need not be concerned about pain. As the bone bonds to the post, it forms a secure foundation onto which your new teeth are then attached and shaped to match your mouth. The number of teeth being replaced will determine the best kind of restoration for you. Implants can help replace a single tooth, or a full set of teeth. If you have been suffering with partial or full dentures, or are missing teeth, or feel you need teeth extracted, do not hesitate to call to be evaluated for implants.
