                    Although we are not participants in any dental plans, we are glad to accept payments from any dental insurance plan that allows you to choose a dentist freely. We do not accept any dental HMO plans.
                    <br /><br />
                    As a courtesy to you, we will file insurance paperwork and collect the insurance portion of your fee.  We do ask that you pay your portion of the fee at the time of your appointment.
                    <br /><br />
                    We want you to get the dental care that you want and need, so we offer ways to make it more affordable.
                    <br /><br />
                    We accept cash, check and credit card.<br />
                    We offer a courtesy discount on prepayments for dental treatments.
                    <br /><br />
                    We offer Zero and deferred-interest payment plans through CareCredit.
