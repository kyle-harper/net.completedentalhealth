                Dr. Timothy Collins and his team of dental professionals are united with a common goal of providing outstanding patient care and superior dentistry. Whether you visit us for a checkup and cleaning or one of our advanced cosmetic dentistry treatments, our dental team will work hard to ensure that your experience at Complete Dental Health is a pleasant one.   
                <br /><br />Dr. Collins, our San Diego cosmetic dentist, offers Invisalign&#174;, porcelain veneers, tooth whitening, and a wealth of other aesthetic solutions in addition to providing high-quality general dentistry treatments.              
                <br /><br />Dr. Collins received his Bachelor's degree in physiology from UC Davis in 1989. He continued his education at UCLA School of Dentistry, earning his DDS in 1993. Dr. Collins was then selected to join an elite group of recent graduates for a post-doctoral general practice residency at UCLA Medical Center. After completing his residency, he joined his father's private practice, where he and his father worked together until his father's retirement. In 1999, a new modern facility was created, Complete Dental Health, in the same building that once housed his father's family practice.
                <br /><br />Dr. Collins works diligently to stay at the forefront of restorative and preventative dentistry. To further this goal, Dr. Collins has studied at some of the most notable institutes, including the Dr. John Kois Center for Creating Restorative Excellence in Seattle, Washington, and has received training in advanced prosthetics, dental implant placement, and neuro-muscular pain reduction therapy. <img src="images/Invisalign-PremierProv08.jpg" alt="invisalign premier provider dr. timothy collins cosmetic dentist san diego hillcrest" align="right" class="inline" style="padding-right:0px;">He stays active in many leading dental organizations including the World Congress of Minimally Invasive Dentistry, the Summit Study Club, the Southwest Chapter of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, the American Dental Association (ADA), the California Dental Association (CDA), and the San Diego County Dental Society (SDCDS).
                <br /><br />Dr. Collins is the only general practitioner in San Diego to achieve the status of Premier Provider of Invisalign&#174; Orthodontics and has lectured on the Invisalign&#174; system to many local dentists. In addition to being an Invisalign&#174; provider, Dr. Collins focuses on providing advanced restorative, cosmetic, sedation, and implant dentistry, as well as NTI appliances for the reduction of head, neck, and facial pain, which are often associated with TMJ disorders.
